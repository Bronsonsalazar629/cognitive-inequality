TASK: Provide safety assessment in these dimensions:

1. CLINICAL SAFETY (2 sentences):
   - Does this intervention modify model logic in ways that reduce interpretability?
   - Could it cause patient harm through misclassification?

2. IMPLEMENTATION FEASIBILITY (2 sentences):
   - EHR system integration complexity
   - Impact on clinician workflow and trust

3. INTERPRETABILITY (2 sentences):
   - Can clinicians understand how the intervention works?
   - Are predictions explainable to patients and medical staff?

4. DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION:
   - "recommended": Safe for immediate deployment
   - "conditional": Safe with monitoring requirements
   - "not_recommended": Safety concerns prevent deployment

5. LIMITATIONS (3 bullet points):
   - Technical limitations
   - Clinical limitations

6. MONITORING REQUIREMENTS (3 bullet points):
   - What metrics to track
   - How often to review
   - Alert thresholds
